## How it works

1. Prompts you for input
1. If "answered", a second prompt asks if you want to save the answer (this can be skipped)
1. If "yes", the answer is persisted to a [local data store](#data-store), and the prompt will be skipped the next time the same question is asked. 

This is really simple and basic at the moment, it would probably be good to keep it that way. There are lots of interesting things we can do with prompts and templates, but it would be better to do those things with custom implementations.

## Usage

Register as an async helper with [assemble][], [generate][], [templates][] or any library that uses [async-helpers][].

```js
var prompt = require('{%= name %}');
var assemble = require('assemble');
var app = assemble();

// "app" can be any of the mentioned libraries above
app.asyncHelper('prompt', prompt());
```

## Example

```js
var templates = require('templates');
var app = templates();

app.engine('hbs', require('engine-handlebars'));
app.asyncHelper('prompt', prompt({save: false}));

app.create('pages');
app.page('example.hbs', 'My name is: {{prompt "What is your name?"}}');

app.render('example.hbs', function(err, view) {
  if (err) {
    console.log(err);
    process.exit(1);
  }
  console.log(view.contents.toString());
  //=> 'My name is: Jon'
});
```

## Options

### options.save

**Type**: `boolean`

**Default**: `undefined` 

By default, you will be prompted to confirm whether or not an answer value should be persisted. You can disable this by setting `options.save` to false.

```js
var prompt = require('{%= name %}');
var assemble = require('assemble');
var app = assemble();

app.asyncHelper('prompt', prompt({save: false}));
```


### options.prompt

**Type**: `boolean`

**Default**: `undefined` 

Don't skip the prompt, regardless of whether or not the answer was persisted. This is especially useful when `argv` is passed to helper options.

This is different from `save` in that it forces the prompt to be presented, it does not have any effect on whether or not the answer value is persisted.

```js
var prompt = require('{%= name %}');
var minimist = require('minimist')(process.argv.slice(2));
var assemble = require('assemble');
var app = assemble();

// $ your-app --prompt
app.asyncHelper('prompt', prompt(argv));
```


## Data store

Answer values are persisted using [data-store][]. Options are passed to that library, so you'll need to visit the data-store docs to see all available options and features. 

Here is an example of how to change the path of the data store:

```js
// persist answers to a local folder in "data/prompt-answers.json"
prompt({path: 'data/prompt-answers.json'});
```
