> Async helper that prompts the user for input then uses the answers to render templates. Must be registered with a library that supports async helpers, like assemble or generate. After that it should work with handlebars, lo-dash or any other node.js engine that supports helper functions.

## Install

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```sh
$ npm install --save helper-prompt
```

## How it works

1. Prompts you for input
2. If "answered", a second prompt asks if you want to save the answer (this can be skipped)
3. If "yes", the answer is persisted to a [local data store](#data-store), and the prompt will be skipped the next time the same question is asked.

This is really simple and basic at the moment, it would probably be good to keep it that way. There are lots of interesting things we can do with prompts and templates, but it would be better to do those things with custom implementations.

## Usage

Register as an async helper with [assemble](https://github.com/assemble/assemble), [generate](https://github.com/generate/generate), [templates](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/templates) or any library that uses [async-helpers](https://github.com/doowb/async-helpers).

```js
var prompt = require('helper-prompt');
var assemble = require('assemble');
var app = assemble();

// "app" can be any of the mentioned libraries above
app.asyncHelper('prompt', prompt());
```

## Example

```js
var templates = require('templates');
var app = templates();

app.engine('hbs', require('engine-handlebars'));
app.asyncHelper('prompt', prompt({save: false}));

app.create('pages');
app.page('example.hbs', 'My name is: {{prompt "What is your name?"}}');

app.render('example.hbs', function(err, view) {
  if (err) {
    console.log(err);
    process.exit(1);
  }
  console.log(view.contents.toString());
  //=> 'My name is: Jon'
});
```

## Options

### options.save

**Type**: `boolean`

**Default**: `undefined`

By default, you will be prompted to confirm whether or not an answer value should be persisted. You can disable this by setting `options.save` to false.

```js
var prompt = require('helper-prompt');
var assemble = require('assemble');
var app = assemble();

app.asyncHelper('prompt', prompt({save: false}));
```

## Data store

Answer values are persisted using [data-store](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/data-store). Options are passed to that library, so you'll need to visit the data-store docs to see all available options and features.

Here is an example of how to change the path of the data store:

```js
// persist answers to a local folder in "data/prompt-answers.json"
prompt({path: 'data/prompt-answers.json'});
```
